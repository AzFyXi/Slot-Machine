![Alt text](SlotMachine.gif?raw=true "SlotMachine UI")

# Overview
This Java-based project simulates a slot machine game, implementing object-oriented programming principles such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. It features a variety of betting options, random symbol generation across five reels, and bonus features for an engaging user experience.

# Features
- **Betting Options:** Players can place bets of 2k, 4k, 6k, or 10k.
- **Symbol Variety:** Eight distinct symbols appear randomly across five reels.
- **Dynamic Payouts:** Winnings are calculated based on the number of matching symbols, with multipliers applied for higher bets.
- **Balance Management:** Players start with a balance of 250k, with a maximum number of plays calculated based on bet amounts.
- **Reel Configuration:** The slot machine displays three rows of symbols, with reels 1-4 containing 30 symbols, and reel 5 containing 41.
- **Winning Mechanics:** Matches are made from left to right, with cascading symbols for consecutive wins.
- **Volatility Setting:** A volatility rate of 10% ensures a fair frequency of winning combinations.
- **Special Symbols:** 'Super' symbols act as wild cards, and 'Free' symbols trigger free spins with multipliers.
- **Bonus Rounds:** A 4x5 matrix presents opportunities for additional winnings and multipliers.

# Technologies
- Java
- Swing (for GUI implementation)
- Random Number Generation (RNG) for symbol selection

# Documentation
The code is well-commented, adhering to Java coding standards such as camelCase notation, and is structured for readability with proper indentation and minimal white space.

# Class Diagrams and Design
UML class diagrams and other design documents are available in the docs directory, providing an overview of the architecture and interactions within the application.

# Contribution
This project is the result of a collaborative endeavor by AzFyXi, rems08, and Florian-cop for school
